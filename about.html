                <h1>Music can express emotions that words often can’t. Whether it’s joy, sadness, love, or anger, music provides an outlet for these feelings,<br> helping people process and understand their emotions.</h2>
                <h2> Music is a powerful tool for preserving and sharing cultural heritage. <br> It connects people to their roots and introduces others to different cultures, promoting understanding and appreciation.</h2>
                <h2>music has been a very important aspect of my life . I use is as a means to escape , to rejoice , to vent my anger . <br> BUT what i noticed is that , no matter the emotion i am feeling there is always a song for it <br>which has inspired me to want to make music and share with the world wich can do the same to others as some has done to me </h2>
